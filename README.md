# Laptop-price-predictor

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning (ML), Pickle

This project utilizes machine learning (ML) to predict laptop prices based on various specifications. The model was trained in Jupyter Notebook using Python and saved as a Pickle file for deployment. The web application is built with Flask, allowing users to input laptop features and receive a predicted price based on the trained ML model.
